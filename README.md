# Unit_3_Project

- This was originally going to be a project where ?users were going to make books
then make chapters and reviews for those books. And finally comments on the chapters page
- It turns out that I am not as skilled as i thought in React so i had to minimize it to just 
Books and chapters
- Then i had to deal with React having issues running files that were in the node_modules so
yeah. Problems until the last second
